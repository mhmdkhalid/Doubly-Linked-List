# Student and Doubly Linked List Management

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of two primary data structures in C++:

- **Student List** - a singly linked list to store, manage, and search student records.
- **Doubly Linked List** - a general-purpose doubly linked list that includes advanced operations like concatenation, substring extraction, and in-place replacement.

The project offers a menu-driven interface to manage and manipulate both lists through various operations, making it suitable for beginner to intermediate C++ programmers exploring data structure concepts.

## Features

### Student List (Singly Linked List)
- **Insert**: Add a new student record (name, ID, GPA) in sorted order by ID.
- **Remove**: Delete a student record by ID.
- **Search**: Locate a student record by ID.
- **Display**: Print all student records along with the total number of students.

### Doubly Linked List Operations
- **Insert at Position**: Insert a character at the beginning, end, or a specified position in the list.
- **Delete at Position**: Remove a character at a specified position.
- **Concatenate**: Merge two lists.
- **Substring Extraction**: Extract a specified portion of the list as a new list.
- **Substring Search**: Find the position of a substring within the list.
- **Replace**: Replace occurrences of one substring with another.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the list in-place.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Program**: Start the program to access the menu options.
2. **Select an Operation**: Follow prompts to manage either the Student List or Doubly Linked List.
3. **Input Data**: Enter data as prompted for each specific operation, such as adding students, concatenating lists, or replacing substrings.

## Requirements
- **C++ Compiler** (C++11 or higher)

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for this project include:
- Adding error handling for edge cases.
- Implementing sorting and filtering options for the Student List.
- Adding more customizable operations to the Doubly Linked List.
